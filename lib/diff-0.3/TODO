= For 1.0:

  * Settle on a diff format, e.g. what should the first field look like:
	[ '+', 23, "foo" ]
	[ :add, 23, "foo" ]
	[ DiffAdd, 23, "foo" ]
    or should we have classed
	class DiffAdd
		attr_reader :position, :element
	end

= Other Ideas:

  * Contextual diffs?
  * Unix diff/patch compatible wrapper
