ABOUT

    This implementation is basically a Ruby conversion of the Perl
    Algorithm::Diff module in CPAN.

    Diff is an algorithm which computes the differences between two
    lists a and b. The resulting set of differences can be applied to
    a (also called "patching") to get b. This is also what the Unix
    command line tools "diff" and "patch" are able to do.

    diff.rb generates a "minimal diff". This means that the set of
    changes that should be applied to a to get b can not be fewer than
    those generated by diff.rb. diff.rb does not generate contextual
    diffs. Therefor, the diff can only be succesfully applied to a
    list exactly equal to to original a.

    Documentation is in RD format in diff.rb. Ruby rd2 on it to
    extract into other formats.

INSTALLATION

    You should not installed this library system wide, because it is a
    work in progress and the API may still change. You should place
    the file "diff.rb" together with the source that needs to use it
    and simply put "require 'diff'" at the top of your program file.
